# Objective: 

### Learn how to access cloud services and how to upload data to their two storage services, in particular, object store and NoSQL table.

#### Instruction:

Download the assignment2.tgz and uncompress the file which will give you a CSV file, Big3CloudProviders.txt, and picture files in the LogoFile directory.

Each line in this CSV file has the following format: 

        cloud provider, company, start year, size of the logo file, logo filename

Your job is to (similar to what we do for the example in the class)

1. Upload the picture files to the object store

2. Build a NoSQL table from Big3CloudProviders.txt and add another field to link to the logo file objectâ€™s URL

3. Once done, find a way to show that all picture files are uploaded to the object store and the table is build. You can capture screen for the proof.
